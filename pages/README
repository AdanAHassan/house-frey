The reason I am using dynamic pages is because I want to add more pages onto this project into the future. As of the time I am writing this the current AWOIAF wiki has 8,769 articles. The build time for this would be massive and the files will be close to impossible for me to individually manage. Instead of creating each individual page I am going to limit myself to a handful of dynamic pages which will render the desired page when the user wishes to visit the site. The data will be stored on a json file. This is a wiki in which the structure of the pages will be practically identical. For proof that this actually work for different pages. I initally began this with a complete redesign of the wiki page structure but during the course of the project I have realised the value in the current design and implemented more of it into the project.
